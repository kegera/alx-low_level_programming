This project contains examples of how to create and use dynamic libraries in C.

Dynamic libraries are shared libraries that can be loaded and unloaded at runtime. They are often used to provide common functionality to multiple programs, such as mathematical functions or graphical user interface elements.

Creating dynamic libraries
To create a dynamic library in C, you must compile your code with the -fPIC compiler flag. This tells the compiler to produce position-independent code, which can be loaded at any address in memory.

Once you have compiled your code, you can use the gcc or clang linker to create a shared object file. This file will have a .so extension.

For example, to create a dynamic library called libmylib.so, you would use the following command:

gcc -shared -o libmylib.so mylib.o
Using dynamic libraries
To use a dynamic library in your C program, you must link it with the library at runtime. This can be done using the -l linker flag.

For example, to link your program with the libmylib.so library, you would use the following command:

gcc -o myprogram myprogram.o -lmylib
Once your program is compiled, you can run it as usual. The dynamic library will be loaded automatically when the program starts.
